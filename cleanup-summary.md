# Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup actions performed on the project.

## Initial Cleanup

- Removed duplicate/backup files:
  - `next.config.js.bak`
  - `next.config.js.original` 
  - `package.json.bak`
  - `package.json.original`
  - `package.json.js`
  - `tsconfig.json.bak`

- Removed duplicate TypeScript files that had JavaScript equivalents:
  - `app/components/FancyButton.tsx`
  - `app/components/FancySection.tsx`
  - `app/players/page.tsx`
  - `app/rankings/page.tsx`
  - `app/rulebook/page.tsx`
  - `app/schedules/page.tsx`
  - `app/standings/page.tsx`
  - `app/teams/[teamName]/page.tsx`

## Configuration and Documentation

- Updated `jsconfig.json` to properly configure JavaScript support
- Modified `tsconfig.json` to include JavaScript files as well as TypeScript files
- Updated `README.md` to reflect JavaScript project structure
- Updated `JS_CONVERSION_README.md` with information about all converted files

## Final Cleanup (Latest)

1. **Fixed ESLint Errors**
   - Fixed unescaped entities in JSX (`'` â†’ `&apos;`) in:
     - `app/page.jsx`
     - `app/players/page.jsx`
     - `app/teams/[teamName]/page.jsx`
   - Updated anchor elements to use Next.js Link components for internal navigation
   - Enhanced `ImageWithFallback` component with proper Next.js Image support

2. **Removed TypeScript Backup**
   - Deleted the `typescript_backup` folder as it's no longer needed

3. **Final ESLint Check**
   - Ran `npm run lint` to verify all critical errors are fixed
   - Documented remaining non-critical warnings for future improvements

## Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

1. **Performance Recommendations**
   - Consider replacing `<img>` elements with Next.js `<Image>` components for optimized image loading
   
2. **React Hook Dependencies**
   - Some useEffect hooks have missing dependencies that should be included

3. **Unused Variables**
   - Several unused variables could be removed for cleaner code

This cleanup provides a more organized project structure with no duplicate files, consistent JavaScript usage, proper documentation, and fixed critical ESLint errors.
