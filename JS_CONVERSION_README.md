# TypeScript to JavaScript Conversion

This directory contains JavaScript (.jsx and .js) versions of the original TypeScript files (.tsx and .ts) for the Beluga League website.

## File Conversions

The following files have been converted from TypeScript to JavaScript:

### Components
- `app/components/BackgroundDecoration.jsx`
- `app/components/FancyButton.jsx`
- `app/components/FancySection.jsx`
- `app/components/Footer.jsx`
- `app/components/ImageWithFallback.jsx`
- `app/components/Navigation.jsx`

### Pages
- `app/layout.jsx`
- `app/page.jsx`
- `app/development/page.jsx`
- `app/players/page.jsx`
- `app/rankings/page.jsx`
- `app/rulebook/page.jsx`
- `app/schedules/page.jsx`
- `app/standings/page.jsx`
- `app/teams/[teamName]/page.jsx`

### API Routes
- `app/api/standings/route.js`

### Library Files
- `lib/sheets.js`

### Configuration Files
- `next.config.js.bak` - Backup of the original Next.js configuration
- `package.json.bak` - Modified package.json without TypeScript dependencies

## Project Organization

The project has been fully converted to JavaScript. Here are the key organizational points:

1. All TypeScript files have been converted to JavaScript:
   - `.tsx` → `.jsx` for React components
   - `.ts` → `.js` for utility files
   
2. Configuration has been updated:
   - `jsconfig.json` added for JavaScript intellisense
   - `tsconfig.json` updated to include JavaScript files for compatibility
   - `package.json` updated to remove TypeScript dependencies
   
3. Original TypeScript files have been preserved in the `typescript_backup` directory for reference

4. Conversion script (`convert-to-js.ps1`) is available for converting any future TypeScript files to JavaScript

## Key Changes in the Conversion

- Removed TypeScript type annotations and interfaces
- Simplified function parameter definitions
- Removed React event type definitions
- Kept the same functional logic and component structure
- Preserved all styling and Tailwind CSS classes
- Maintained the same imports and dependencies (except TypeScript)

## Next Steps

After replacing the files, you should:

1. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
2. Test the site locally with `npm run dev`
3. Make sure all features work as expected
4. Deploy the JavaScript version of your site

The JavaScript version should function identically to the TypeScript version, just without the type safety provided by TypeScript.
