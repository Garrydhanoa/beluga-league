## Data Fetching System

### Google Sheets Integration
- Connected to Google Sheets API using JWT authentication from credentials.json
- Mapped column indices correctly:
  - Team name: column 9
  - Wins: column 10 
  - Losses: column 11
  - Game Diff: column 12
  - Goal Diff: column 13
  - Place: column 7 (contains values like "1st", "2nd")

### Caching Implementation
- Added 30-minute data caching system to minimize API calls
- Cache structure stores data per division
- Implemented proper timestamp tracking for cache expiry
- Added cache status indicators in the UI

### Error Handling
- When API calls fail, system uses cached data if available
- Added clear UI indicators when showing cached vs fresh data
- Provided "Refresh Now" button to retry fetching fresh data
- Gracefully handles all error cases with appropriate messages

## UI Enhancements
- Added color-coded indicators for playoff qualification status
- Enhanced cache status banners with clear messaging
- Improved sorting functionality with visual indicators
- Fixed hydration mismatches by making random elements client-side only

## Code Improvements
- Added proper JSDoc comments for better code documentation
- Cleaned up debugging code with conditional flags
- Properly extracts position numbers from strings like "1st", "2nd"
- Standardized team names using canonical mapping

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed team statistics when available
- Consider implementing offline mode for complete resilience
